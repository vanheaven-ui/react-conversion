# React Multi-Page Application

This project is a demonstration of a multi-page React application built with TypeScript and React Router, showcasing a structured approach to component organization and styling. It simulates a typical React project setup with separate files for components and their dedicated CSS.

## Overview

This application serves as a practical example to demonstrate how a ReactJS application can be structured with multiple pages, state management, and routing. It's designed to be a starting point for understanding how to build a client-side application without relying on a full-fledged backend for routing.

## Features

- **Multi-Page Navigation**: Utilizes `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, allowing seamless navigation between different sections of the application without full page reloads.
- **Home Page**: A simple landing page introducing the application.
- **Counter Page**: A dynamic counter demonstrating basic state management and event handling. Users can increment and decrement a numerical value.
- **List Page**: A dynamic list where users can add new items. This demonstrates handling user input and updating a list of items.
- **Modular Components**: Each page/feature is encapsulated within its own React component.
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript for enhanced code quality and developer experience.
- **Separated Styles**: CSS for common elements is in a simulated `App.css`, while each component has its own dedicated CSS (embedded within the component for this demonstration).

---

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **React Router DOM**: A collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
